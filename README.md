In this repository we provide the code to reproduce the results we have published in our paper Gramian Angular Fields for leveraging pre-trained computer vision models with anomalous diffusion trajectories

Code used to produce Gramian Angular Fields images from anomalous diffusing trajectories.

Code used to train the regression and the classification task.

Code used to predict new data.
